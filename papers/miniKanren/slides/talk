1:
Hi, I am going to talk about our empitical study of partial deduction for miniKanren.

2: 
The aim of our research is to find a good way to automatically specialize programs in miniKanren. 
Specialization is a method to improve the performance of programs given some information about how the program is going to be run. 
Partial deduction is specialization of logic languages.
For example, here we see the fragment of the miniKanren relation which evaluates a logic formula fm in the given substitution s. 
One of the cases here is when the formula is a negation of another formula, 'x'. 
In this case we need to recursively call the relation evalo on the 'x', and then negate its result. 

2.1:
Let's consider that we know that the formula should evaluate to true. 

2.2:
In this case we can propagate the value of the 'r' variable. 
Now we know that `not a` is true, thus we can derive that a must be false. 

2.3:
Since 'a' is false, we know that the formula 'x' should evaluate to false. 

2.4: 
Then we need to specialize the recursive call further.

2.5: 
As a result we will get something like this. 
Two mutually recursive relations evalo-true and evalo-false, specialized for two possible values of the input formula. 
These relations do not have to evaluate noto and other boolean connectives thus being more performant. 


3: 
As a first approximation, partial deduction works like this. 
The input is a program and a specific goal to specialize: it may have some arguments known, for example.

3.1: 
A *process tree* is constructed by the program and the goal by driving
The process tree represents the execution for the given goal. 
This tree is often infinite and self-similar.

3.2: 
*Folding* generates some finite graph which represents the infinite tree. 
The main way to fold is to identify nodes in the trees which are instances or renamings of some other nodes within the tree.
Here the two leaves are renamings of the root nodes, unfolding them will generate the tree which is similar to the one we've already constructed thus we can stop driving them and just add a back edge into the tree

3.3:
The specialized program is generated from the folded process tree by the process called residualization.
When doing residualization, backedges become calls for the new relations. 
The computed substitutions become unifications, branches become disjunctions and so on. 
The performance gain in specialization comes from removing intermidiate computations which is done at this stage. 

4: 
Unfolding is at the core of driving. 
Let me demonstrate unfolding informally by example. 
We start by symbolic execution of the input goal.

4.1: 
We replace the call with the body of the relation and substitute all known arguments. 
If there is a disjunction, we process each disjunct individually.

This disjunct is a conjunction with a unification for the formula. 
All unifications are computed into substitutions. 
We stop unfolding when all leaves in are conjunctions of relation calls. 

Sometimes unfolding is trivial as for ando here. 
and sometimes we find failed branches, when unification fails, as for nando. 

We remove all failed branches, and omit intermidiate nodes. 
The result of one step of unfolding is a disjunction of conjunctions of relation calls in some substitutions. 
These conjunctions of calls and substitutions are terms in the process trees. 

5:
Dealing with disjunctions and unifications is easy, but what to do if there is a conjunction of several relation calls? 
The classic partial deduction splits a conjunction into individual relation calls much like it does with disjunctions.
Then each relation call is unfolded in isolation. 
At residualization stage, a conjunction is constructed from the split node.  
Note that by splitting we often loose some data essential for specialization. 
Here, once we split, there is no way to convay that 'a' and 'b' are supposed to be true in this calls to evalo, thus partial deduction cannot improve this program. 

6: 
*Conjunctive* partial deduction attempts to battle this shortcoming by treating conjunctions as a whole. 
It does not split the conjunction right away and instead selects one relation call to unfold, unfolds it once in the context of the other calls and then drives the constructed conjunction. 
Here, after we unfolded the evalo, we get a conjunction of calls to ando and evalo. 
We select the leftmost call ando, and unfold it.
As a result we get a substitution that a and b are true. 
We replace the ando call in the conjunction with the rusult of its unfolding and apply the substitutions to the other calls. 
Then CPD unfolds the next leftmost call.

7: 
Look at what happens next. 
By unfolding this evalo call we get a new conjunction of three relation calls, and if we unfold ando here, we will get three evalo calls. 
This lead to the uncontrollable growth in the number of conjunctions, which impacts termination of specialization. 
This is why split is still necessary, and if we split this conjunction, we will get two renamings of the root node and thus may stop unfolding. 

8: 
It is time to note that there are many ways to split a conjunction into subconjunctions. 
If we have three relation calls, we can either split any relation call from two other relation calls, or split the whole conjunction into individual calls. 
It is not always clear which way is the most reasonable and will provide the best specialization. 
CPD attempts to split conjunctions depending on the shared variables and predeccessors of the node. 

9: 
There are many decisions to be made in partial deduction. 
We need to decide what to unfold: which calls within a conjunction and how many of them. 
CPD selects the leftmost call which does not have a predecessor embedded into it. 
Embedding determines how similar terms are: a term is embedded into another if you can get it by striking out something from the other term. 
This relation helps to detect if there is some patterns which are going to lead to the uncontrollable growth within terms and, correspondingly, nontermination. 

The other decision we need to make is how to unfold and when to stop unfolding.
CPD unfolds a relation call only once. 

We also have to decide when to stop driving and when to split a conjunction. 
CPD stops driving when all leaves are either some substitutions or are instances of other nodes in the process tree. 
The decision to split is based on embedding.

There are advantages and disadvantages to every decision made. 

10:
Let's take a closer look at how CPD behaves when specializing the evalo relation. 
Consider the evaluator of logic formula 'fm' in a substitution 's'. 
A formula can be either a variable, a negation of another formula, a disjunction or a conjunction of two subformulas. 
In the case formula is a variable, we lookup its value in the substitution. 
Otherwise we evaluate subformulas and then use boolean connectives to compute the result. 
Note that this time we will put all boolean relations last withing conjunctions.

Let's run CPD on 'evalo' with the last argument fixed to be true. 
We get four branches after one step of unfolding.
Note that true is propagated into the boolean relations noto, oro and ando. 

11: 
At the next step of unfolding, the first recursive call to evalo is selected and unfolded, producing new 4 branches. 
Note that at this stage all variables in the evalo call are free, 
and we know absolutely nothing about these evalo calls. 
Unfolding calls to evalo in the two branches for conjunction and disjunction we will get 16 new branches, so our tree will become very wide and the residualized program will end up very large. 
This problem of too much unfolding leads to program which may behave even worse than the original. 

It would be much better if we were to first unfold the call to noto, since this way we can compute the value of 'a' to be false.
But there is no way to achieve this with CPD, because of its leftmost unfolding strategy. 

12: 
The other two relations --- oro and ando --- also allow us to compute some information about the recursive calls to evalo. 
We can see, that there is only one possible substitution for variables in calls to noto and ando, and there are three possibilities for oro.

13:
If we were to unfold noto first, we would only get one branch in the process tree for negation. 

14: 
The same goes for other cases. 
Look at the process tree after two unfoldings.
We get only 5 nodes at the second level instead of dozens we would get by selecting the first node.
Let's take a look at this node. 
Here we have a conjunction of two calls of evalo: one specialized to true and another -- to false. 
It is a good time to make a split. 
There is no reason to unfold 'evalo x s true', since we will get the same tree we've already constructed. 
We will still have to unfold 'evalo x s false', and we get similar tree, with three possible branches for conjunction, and one for negation and disjunction. 

14.1:
All nodes which are left in this tree are instances of the root node and this node, and thus we  can fold and stop driving.

15: 
The decision to unfold calls from left to right is perfectly reasonable in the setting of prolog, especially if we want to guarantee semantics preservation. 
But since miniKanren employs interleaving and is capable to eventually find all answers, it is safe to reorder some calls and thus it is safe to unfold calls which are not leftmost. 
We thus came up with conservative partial deduction which suits miniKanren better. 
The core idea here is to find a relation call within a conjunction, which restricts the search space and unfold it first. 
This way the constructed process tree should be smaller and we also get rid of as many computations which will not produce the answer as possible. 

So to do so, we first split a conjunction into individual calls. 
We drive each call in isolation. 
This driving continues until we encounter embedding: this makes it possible to unfold multiple times and guarantee termination. 
Then we examine process trees for the calls. 
We find a call which narrows the search space using the less-branching heuristics
Then we join the conjunction back together. 
We replace the selected call with the result of its unfolding (a disjunction of conjunctions and substitutions). 
We do not unfold other calls at this step. 
We then continue driving the constructed conjunction. 

16: 
We came up with the less-branching heuristics to select the call which narrows down the seach space and thus should be unfolded. 
We unfold the call once and check if it unfolds into less branches than it does in isolation. 
For example, ando being applied to free variables produce four branches, but if we fix the last argument to be true, then only one branch is in the process tree, thus it is reasonable to unfold this call. 

17: 
We implemented our proposed approach and compared it to our earlier implementation of conjunctive partial deduction as well as CPD which employs branching heuristics. 
We evaluated the approach on 4 relations. 
2 implementations of the evalo relation which are very different from the standpoint of CPD; 
A program to compute a unifier of two terms 
and a program to search for paths of a specifica length in the graph. 

18:
The two implementations of evalo which we use are different in, first of all, the placement of the boolean relation calls.  
The one where they are placed last are much harder for CPD to specialize. 

19: 
Another issue for CPD comes from how the boolean connectives are implemented. 
There are two ways to implement ando, for example. 
One is table based where we just enumerate all possible values for all variables in relation. 
The other way is more generic: we can define all boolean relations via nando, which is in turn table based. 
Since CPD only unfolds each relation once, it won't be able to derive there are only three possible values for 'x' and 'y' so that their conjunction evaluates to true. 
This creates even more disparity in the specialization results.
Conservative partial deduction treats both these implementation pretty much the same, driving the calls until it computes substitutions. 

21: 
Our evaluation confirmed that CPD behaves very differently on these two implementations of the same relation. 
CPD improves the execution time of the plain relation, however CPD performs too much unfolding of the last relation which is why the specialized relation last fails to terminate in under 10 seconds. 
The execution time of two programs generated with the novel conservative partial deduction is very similar and it is a little bit better than the best by CPD. 
CPD with the less-branching heuristic constructs residual programs of different quality, worsening the execution time for both implementations.

22: 
We have also evaluated our approach on the unification problem. 
We specialized the unification relation to return some answer and then run a query to find a unifier of these two complex terms. 

23:
The other relation was to search for paths in a graph, and the query was to find 5 paths in a graph with 20 vertices and 30 edges. 

24: 
The evaluation results are summed up in this table. 
Dashes here mean that the evaluation did not terminate in under 30 seconds. 
We can see, that although conservative partial deduction shows the best result for 3 out of 4 programs, it does perform worse than CPD which employs the branching heuristics. 

25: 
In conclusion, we discussed what kinds of desicions are needed to be done to create a specializer for miniKanren. 
We developed and implemented conservative partial deduction and came up with the less-branching heuristics. 
Evaluation does show some improvement, but unfortunatelly not for every query. 
We believe it is necessary to develop good models which are capable to predict the execution time for a given query which should help to create a specialization method which is more predictable and does not depend as much on the order of relation calls and implementations of relations.
