\section{Non-conjunctive Partial Deduction}

We came up with the idea.

Here we'll briefly describe it.

First we build a tree, than we generate a residual program from it. Residualization is more or less trivial, once the tree is built.

Building the tree is... Well... Complicated.

There are issues with when to unfold, when to stop.

There are a bunch of heuristics for it.


\subsection{Unfolding}

Unfolding is when a call to a relation is substituted by its body.

The most important question is when to unfold.

To much unfolding is sometimes is even worse than not enough unfolding.

\subsection{Heuristic}

First we unfold those conjuncts which are static.

Then --- deterministic.

Then those which are less branching.

The last to be unfolded are those calls, which unfold to a substitution.
